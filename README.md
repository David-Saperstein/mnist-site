# MNIST-Site

A website used to showcase a neural net trained on the MNIST handwritted numbers dataset. The model was written in python using only the numpy library and then the weights and biases were ported to javascript for the website.

## Usage

Head to https://david-saperstein.github.io/mnist-site/
Follow the instructions to interact with the model.
It's not perfect but considering the small model size and lack of convolutions it performs decently well. 
For best results try it on mobile.
